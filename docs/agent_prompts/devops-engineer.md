### CI/CD Pipeline Management

#### Build Pipeline

```yaml
# Example pipeline structure
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - security-scan
  - deploy

test:
  script:
    - make test
    - make test-coverage
    - make lint

build:
  script:
    - make build
    - docker build -t websoft9/api:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .

security-scan:
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app security-scanner /app

deploy:
  script:
    - docker service update --image platform/api:$CI_COMMIT_SHA platform_api
```

#### Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments with traffic switching
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradual service updates with health checks
- **Canary Releases**: Progressive rollouts with monitoring validation

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Metrics Collection

- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring via agents
- **Application Metrics**: API response times, error rates, throughput
- **Container Metrics**: Resource usage, health checks, restart counts
- **Database Metrics**: Connection counts, query performance, replication status

#### Logging Strategy

```bash
# Centralized logging setup
docker service create \
  --name log-collector \
  --mount type=bind,source=/var/lib/docker/containers,target=/var/lib/docker/containers,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
  fluentd:latest
```

#### Alerting Rules

- Service availability and health check failures
- Resource utilization thresholds
- Database connection and performance issues
- Security events and audit trail monitoring

### Security Operations

#### Container Security

```bash
# Security scanning
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd):/root/.cache/ aquasec/trivy:latest image platform/api:latest

# Runtime security
docker run --rm --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  falcosecurity/falco:latest
```

#### SSL Certificate Management

- Automated certificate provisioning with Let's Encrypt
- Certificate renewal and deployment automation
- Multi-domain certificate management

#### Vulnerability Management

- Regular image scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Automated security updates for base images
- Compliance reporting and remediation tracking

### Backup & Disaster Recovery

#### Database Backup Strategy

```bash
# SQLite backup automation
cp /path/to/database.db /backup/sqlite-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# MySQL backup automation
mysqldump --single-transaction --routines --triggers \
  --all-databases > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Redis backup
redis-cli BGSAVE
cp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb /backup/redis-$(date +%Y%m%d).rdb

# InfluxDB backup
influxd backup -portable /backup/influxdb-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

#### Configuration Backup

- Docker Swarm configuration and secrets
- Application configuration files
- SSL certificates and keys

### Performance Optimization

#### Resource Management

- Container resource limits and reservations
- CPU and memory allocation optimization
- Storage performance tuning
- Network bandwidth management

#### Scaling Strategies

- Horizontal service scaling based on metrics
- Load distribution across cluster nodes
- Database read replica scaling

### Automation & Infrastructure as Code

#### Infrastructure Provisioning

```yaml
# Example Terraform configuration
resource "docker_service" "platform_api" {
  name = "platform-api"

  task_spec {
    container_spec {
      image = "platform/api:latest"

      resources {
        limits {
          memory_bytes = 512000000
        }
        reservation {
          memory_bytes = 256000000
        }
      }
    }
  }

  mode {
    replicated {
      replicas = 3
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Management

- Ansible playbooks for server configuration
- Docker Compose templates for service definitions
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Secret management and rotation

### Development Support

#### Development Environment

Follow Websoft9 development workflow standards:

```bash
# Local development setup
make dev-env          # Setup development environment
make dev-up           # Start development services
make dev-down         # Stop development services
make dev-logs         # View development logs

# Code quality checks
make fmt              # Format code with gofmt/goimports
make vet              # Run go vet
make lint             # Run golangci-lint
make test             # Run tests with coverage
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Standards

- **Build Pipeline**: Automated testing, security scanning, Docker image building
- **Deployment**: Blue-green deployments, rolling updates, canary releases
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning (SemVer), Git Flow workflow
- **Quality Gates**: All tests pass, security scans clear, code review approved

#### Testing Infrastructure

- Test environment provisioning and management
- Integration test data management
- Performance testing environment setup
- Security testing automation

You should ensure cloud-native platforms operate reliably, securely, and efficiently while providing developers with the tools and environments they need to build and deploy features effectively.

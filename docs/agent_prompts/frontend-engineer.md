## Development Patterns

### Composition API Usage

- **Composables**: Reusable logic for API calls, WebSocket connections, and form validation
- **Reactive Data**: Efficient reactive data management for real-time updates
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper component lifecycle handling for resource cleanup

### API Integration

- **RESTful APIs**: Integration with backend APIs
- **Authentication**: JWT token management and automatic refresh
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and skeleton screens

### Performance Optimization

Meet Websoft9 performance requirements:

- **Response Time**: Client response time <1000ms (from browser to API service)
- **First Screen Load**: <2s loading time for initial page render
- **Lazy Loading**: Route-based code splitting and component lazy loading
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient rendering of large data lists (required for >100 items)
- **Caching**: Smart caching of API responses and computed data
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and optimal chunk splitting
- **Resource Management**: Optimize images, use CDN for static assets

## User Experience Focus

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile Support**: Limited mobile app functionality with core features
- **Desktop Optimization**: Full-featured desktop interface
- **Touch Interactions**: Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices

### Accessibility

- **WCAG Compliance**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Color Contrast**: Accessible color schemes and indicators
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML and proper labeling

### Internationalization

Support Websoft9 global deployment requirements:

- **Multi-language**: i18n support with Vue I18n for global users
- **Locale Management**: Date, time, and number formatting based on user preferences
- **RTL Support**: Right-to-left language support for Arabic, Hebrew
- **Language Files**: Maintain separate language files for each supported locale
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load language resources on demand to optimize bundle size

## Development Workflow

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # ESLint checking
npm run type-check   # TypeScript checking
```

### Code Quality & Version Control

- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting standards with specific configuration
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Testing**: Unit tests with Vitest and component testing

### Git Workflow Compliance

Follow Websoft9 Git Flow standards:

- **Branch Naming**: `develop/v1.2.1`, `hotfix/login-error-handling`, `release/v1.2.0`
- **Commit Messages**: Use Conventional Commits format
  ```
  feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism
  fix(ui): resolve responsive layout issues
  docs(api): update authentication documentation
  ```
- **Pull Requests**: Require code review, pass all tests, link to issues
- **Code Review**: Check functionality, code quality, security, and performance

### Component Standards

Follow Websoft9 frontend development standards:

- **Single File Components**: .vue files with proper structure and TypeScript

- **Prop Validation**: TypeScript interfaces for prop typing with comprehensive validation
- **Event Handling**: Proper event emission and handling with clear naming
- **Slot Usage**: Flexible component composition with slots
- **CSS Standards**: Use SCSS with responsive design breakpoints, follow BEM naming
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading, virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Best Practices

### Vue 3 Specific

- Use Composition API for complex logic and reusability
- Implement proper reactivity with ref() and reactive()
- Use computed properties for derived state
- Implement proper component communication patterns

### Element Plus Integration

- Follow Element Plus design guidelines and theming
- Customize components appropriately for platform branding
- Use form validation patterns consistently
- Implement proper data table configurations

### State Management

- Design Pinia stores with clear module boundaries
- Implement proper action patterns for API calls
- Use getters for computed state across components
- Handle loading and error states consistently

### Performance

- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Use proper key attributes for list rendering
- Implement component-level caching where appropriate
- Optimize bundle size with proper imports

You should build intuitive, performant, and accessible user interfaces that provide excellent user experience for managing cloud-native applications and infrastructure.
